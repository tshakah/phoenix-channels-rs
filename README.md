# phoenix-channels-rs

A Rust library providing functionality to connect to a phoenix channel.

It is intended to become at least a production grade client however it is very early in development
and as such should be treated as experimental.

Currently there are two ways to use this library. The first is a high level threaded client
and the second is a low level sender/receiver.


### Connecting via the client

Connecting via the client will return a tuple with the `Client` struct and a `mpsc::Receiver` of
processed incoming messages. This allows for messages to be received in a separate thread if desired.

An very basic example of connecting with the `Client`:

```rust
extern crate futures;
extern crate tokio_core;
extern crate phoenix_channels;

use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;
use futures::stream::Stream;
use tokio_core::reactor::Core;
use serde_json::json;

use phoenix_channels::client;
use phoenix_channels::client::ClientSender;
use phoenix_channels::event;

let url = "ws://localhost:4000/socket";

let token = "abcde12345";
let params = vec![("token", token)];

let (client, messages) = client::Client::new(url, params, None).unwrap();

let topic = "room:lobby";
client.join(topic).unwrap();

thread::spawn(move || {
  loop {
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(10));
    let msg = json!({"id": 1});
    client.send(topic, event::EventKind::Custom(String::from("shout")), &msg);
  }
});

let runner = messages.for_each(|message| {
  println!("{:?}", message);

  Ok(())
});

let mut core = Core::new().unwrap();
core.run(runner).unwrap();
```

The client itself will handle the heartbeat and anything else required to deliver a serde json struct
to the message iterator result. However, it is an opinionated implementation of a phoenix client and
uses threading, mutexes and channels to achieve its end goal of an easy to use interface. This may not
be desirable for scenarios where more control is required.


### Connecting via the Sender/Receiver

An alternative to the high level `Client` is to purely use the low level `Sender` and `Receiver` structs
and handle the threading and heartbeats yourself. The processing of messages is still handled and methods such
as `join` and `heartbeat` are still conveniently available on the `Sender` struct (the `Client` library
actually uses these under the hood).

Here is an example of how one can use the `Sender`/`Receiver` structs themselves:

```rust
extern crate futures;
extern crate tokio_core;
extern crate phoenix_channels;

use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;
use futures::stream::Stream;
use tokio_core::reactor::Core;
use serde_json::json;

use phoenix_channels::client;
use phoenix_channels::event;

let url = "ws://localhost:4000/socket";

let token = "abcde12345";
let params = vec![("token", token)];

let (mut sender, receiver) = client::connect(url, params, None).unwrap();

let topic = "room:lobby";
sender.join(topic).unwrap();

let sender_ref = Arc::new(Mutex::new(sender));
let sender_heartbeat = Arc::clone(&sender_ref);
let sender_send = Arc::clone(&sender_ref);

thread::spawn(move || {
  loop {
      thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
      // if the mutex is poisoned then the whole thread wont work
      let mut sender = sender_heartbeat.lock().unwrap();
      sender.heartbeat().expect("could not send heartbeat");
  }
});

thread::spawn(move || {
  loop {
      thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(10));
      // if the mutex is poisoned then the whole thread wont work
      let msg = json!({"id": 1});
      let mut sender = sender_send.lock().unwrap();
      sender.send(topic, event::EventKind::Custom(String::from("shout")), &msg).expect("could not send message");
  }
});

let runner = receiver.reader.for_each(|message| {
  println!("{:?}", message);

  Ok(())
});

let mut core = Core::new().unwrap();
core.run(runner).unwrap();
```

Using the lower level API requires more work but it gives you full control over the threading and flow of
messages being sent and received to the server.


### Logging

Both the high level and low level APIs use slog under the hood for structured logging. To enable this
you can pass your logger via both `connect` and `Client::new` by specifying `Some(logger)` where the
examples currently specify `None`.
